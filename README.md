## SPCRT: BIOTS 2018 Hackathon entry

This is a Ethereum DAPP created for the BIOTS 2018 hackathon.

(Sorry for the terrible name)

We tried to tackle the problem that mobile phone hardware is often used very unsustainably.
To give people an incentive to repair, recycle and resell phone hardware,
we came up with an ERC20 compatible token system (SPC) to incentive those actions.

A DAPP using the Metamask framework was created. See https://spcrt.root.sx for a demonstration. You can login with any username/password combination â˜º.
There is no external oracles (yet) that checks if a phone was __actually__ recycled,
so you can get tokens by using the *recylce* functionality, by just writin anything (except 123456) into the valdiation key field.

The Ethereum smart contract lives at `0x0bd69bd276d7c0a205cd7096f65b69e14d369214`.
